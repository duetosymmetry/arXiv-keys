arXiv-keys
==========

Chrome extension which adds navigation keys to the arXiv. Available at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arxiv-keys/fkjjdlbhliopfhgddlpoggpmpgjfaojd

Less clicking, more science! Now you can navigate the arXiv with the keyboard instead of the mouse. This extension adds several "navkey" navigation keys / keyboard shortcuts to arXiv pages.
